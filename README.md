# Fraud-detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions based on transactional features such as amount, account balances, and transaction time. Several machine learning models are implemented and compared, including:

- Random Forest  
- CatBoost  
- LightGBM  
- XGBoost  

Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna to improve model performance.

This notebook provides a comprehensive pipeline from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, focusing on maximizing fraud detection accuracy.
